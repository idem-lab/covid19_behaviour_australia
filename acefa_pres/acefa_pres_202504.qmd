::: {.column width="70%"}

- Have you experienced any of the following symptoms during the past 2 weeks?
- Have you been tested for COVID-19/Coronavirus infection in the past 2 weeks?
- Did you have a PCR test or a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT)? (multiple response available)
- What was the result of your most recent PCR test/RAT?
- Did you report your positive rapid antigen test (RAT) result to a state/territory health department?
- Why did you get a COVID-19 test? (Symptoms/contact/job)

## The Opinion Page
- These data were all very useful!
- Mobility data can't be relied on from BigTech but are there local sources that could be prepared to be stood up in future?
- Questionnaire data had problems with relibility (bots/obviously wrong responses) --- but the still showed a helpful (believeable) trend --- can we delve deeper into this? With social researchers?
- Are independent surveys worth the extra cost above self-selecting ones? (E.g. vis a vis FluTracking v National Survey?)
- Interventions change behaviour!
